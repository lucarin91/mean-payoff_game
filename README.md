# Mean-payoff Game: Algorithms and Optimization
In repository you can find the implementation in C of same algorithms to solve the Mean-payoff problem.
More precise you can find the Zwick-Patersonsame algorithms, the algorithm base on energy games, and two possible optimization. For more detail about Mean-payoff games and the algorithms check the Thesis (in italian).
